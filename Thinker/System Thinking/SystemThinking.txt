system is anything madeup of Parts.

parts not just existing together but influecing each other.

1. System Components
1.1 Elements (Parts)

These are the individual units: CPU, RAM, people, trees, habits, water, hormones, tasks, etc.

1.2 Interconnections (Relationships)

How the elements influence or depend on each other: signals in a motherboard, money flow in an economy, thought → emotion → action in the mind.
Interconnections decide the system’s behavior more than the elements.

1.3 Purpose

Every system has a purpose (declared or hidden).
Brain: survive + predict.
School: education + social order.
Phone apps: maximize engagement.

1.4 Boundaries

What is inside vs outside the system.
Defines inputs, outputs, limits, and what you choose to ignore.

2. Feedback Loops
2.1 Reinforcing Loop (Positive Feedback)

“More → more → more.”
Accelerates growth or decline.
Examples:
• More practice → more skill → more confidence → more practice
• More users → more value → more users
• More stress → less sleep → worse performance → more stress

2.2 Balancing Loop (Negative Feedback)

Stabilizes the system.
Examples:
• Body temperature regulation
• Traffic lights controlling flow
• Tiredness slowing down studying
Balancing loops prevent collapse or runaway behavior.

3. Cause–Effect Mapping
3.1 Linear Thinking

A → B → C. Simple but rarely true for real-world systems.

3.2 Circular Thinking

A affects B,
B affects C,
C loops back and affects A.
Systems behave in circles, not straight lines.

3.3 How to Map Cause–Effect

Identify the event.

Ask: what caused it?

Ask: what does that cause lead to?

See if the effect loops back to influence the cause.

Example (procrastination):
Fear → delay → guilt → more fear → more delay.

3.4 Signs You Understand Systems Thinking

• You see loops, not isolated events
• You focus on structures, not symptoms
• You see small leverage points that change everything
• You recognize that behavior emerges from interactions, not single elements
