First Principles Thinking means breaking any problem or concept down into the smallest, most basic truths, then building your understanding from the bottom up — not from assumptions.

1. Break problems into fundamentals

Think like this:

“Instead of thinking about the computer… think about the electrons inside the wires.”

Always go one layer deeper than normal people go.

Examples:

Don’t think about a “car engine” → think “explosion pushes piston → piston rotates axle.”

Don’t think “charging cable” → think “moving electrons → stored in battery.”

2. Throw away assumptions (trash beliefs)

Most people accept things because everyone uses them.

Example:
“Cars run on petrol → therefore petrol is necessary.”
No.
Petrol is just one solution.
The fundamental need is energy that can move a machine.
Petrol, electricity, hydrogen, compressed air — they’re all implementations.

Same with tech:
“C++ is faster than Python.”
Don’t repeat it blindly.

Ask:

Why

What actually makes something fast?

What happens at the CPU level?

What is compiled code?

What is interpreted code?
This is how you get real truth.

3. Ask “WHY?” again and again

Whenever you believe something, ask:

Why is this true?
Then why again.
Then again.
Stop only when you reach something that cannot be broken further — a true fundamental.

Example:
“Why does phone charge?”

Because battery gets energy.

Why does battery get energy?

Because charger forces electrons in.

Why does that happen?

Because voltage difference pushes charge.

Why does voltage push charge?

Because electric fields move electrons.

Now you hit physics → fundamental.

4. Always rebuild upwards

Once you hit fundamentals, rebuild the whole idea step-by-step.


Electricity moves.

Transistors use electricity to represent 0 and 1.

0/1 combine → logic gates.

Logic gates → CPU.

CPU runs instructions.

Instructions → software.

Software → screen output.

This is first principles thinking in pure form:
bottom → top, no assumptions.

5. First Principles Example (Charging)

If someone asks “how charging works,” don’t start with “USB-C,” “fast charge,” “protocol,” etc.

Start here:

Electricity = tiny charged particles (electrons).

Charger pushes electrons into battery.

Battery stores them in chemical form.

Phone takes these electrons whenever it needs power.

This is the truth.
Everything else (cables, chargers, brands) is not fundamental — just design.

6. Final summary — your mind should work like this

STOP thinking:
“What do people say?”
“What do companies do?”
“What did tutorials teach me?”

START thinking:
“What is the lowest, simplest truth?
What is the real mechanism?
Can I explain this from scratch using only physics + logic?”

That is First Principles Thinking.
